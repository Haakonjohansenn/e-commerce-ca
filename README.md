This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Introduction:
So, I had this assignment where I had to build an online store using a JavaScript framework, and I chose Next.js because it seemed pretty popular and had good documentation. My goal was to make a bunch of pages like the homepage, product page, cart page, and checkout success page using the Noroff API. The idea was to show that I understood how to use frameworks like Next.js to create real-world applications.

Body:
I started off by doing some research to figure out which framework would be the best fit for my project. After looking into a few options, I settled on Next.js because it seemed like it had everything I needed and was beginner-friendly. I spent some time learning about how Next.js works, like its server-side rendering and routing features, and how I could use them to build my online store.

Once I felt comfortable with Next.js, I dove into the development process. I used the Noroff API to fetch product data and then displayed it on the different pages of my store. I had to figure out how to manage things like adding items to the cart and handling the checkout process, which was a bit tricky but also really fun to work on. Throughout the project, I had to rely on my own problem-solving skills and make decisions independently.

Summary:
In the end, I managed to build a pretty cool eCommerce store using Next.js. It was a great learning experience, and I feel like I've got a better grasp on how to use JavaScript frameworks to build real-world applications. I'm excited to keep learning and improving my skills, and who knows, maybe one day I'll be building the next big thing on the web!
